# CSIDNet Honoraria and Non-Staff Compensation Policy (This is a subpage in gitbook)

Note: How will this show up in github? I chose "honoraria" as slug, I'd expect an honoraria.md file. How is Policies/Honoraria.md implemented? Is Policies a folder in github?

This document provides guidelines for honoraria payments and non-staff compensation paid by the CSID Network. Honoraria are paid when a service is provided free-of-charge, and the CSID Network wishes to express gratitude or thanks to the person providing the service. The issuance of honoraria provides a mechanism by which the CSID Network can compensate labor for short-term, one-time engagements in the absence of formal employment or contracting agreements.&#x20;

Non-staff compensation is payment for services rendered via contracting agreement by a consultant or other professional who is not an employee, staff, or fellow of the Network. This policy outlines guidelines for these payments with the knowledge that contractor rates vary and may fall outside of the pay structure detailed below; the Network maintains the discretion to issue payment that differs from this structure if approved by the Interim Managing Director, Fundraising and Finance Committee, and/or other Network decision-making body.

### Context

CSID Network is a global network that prioritizes equity in our science and network-building efforts. As such, we recognize that standards for pay vary widely across sector, geographic location, and perceived expertise. These standards are further impacted by race, class, gender and other social determinants. This policy aims to hold and address these realities to the best of our organizational ability. We strive to acknowledge and at least partially compensate unpaid labor. We also strive to prioritize working with consultants and other professionals who we can pay fairly while responsibly stewarding the funds of our Network.

### Honoraria

Speaking Engagements

Honoraria are provided for invited speakers at CSID Network events including:

* Speakers and panelists on topics of interest to the CSID Network community including educational seminars, guest speakers, and expert-led discussion groups. This includes speakers engaging directly with committee or working group members and public-facing events.
* CSID Network standard honorarium is $100 for a one-time, 60-90 minute time commitment (for the event) plus 60 minute prep call (not public, with staff and/or other speakers), paid to the individual. This applies to individual speakers or speakers on a panel as well as any synchronous translators. Individuals can stipulate fees go to their organization rather than paid to the individual.
* When a speaker feels that this fee does not cover their time, the Network may have the budget to arrange a contract for a more in-depth engagement. A written contract is not necessary for a one-time honorarium. A written contract should be drafted for any consultant work that is more than 5 days of work and equivalent to more than $2,000 USD. Guidelines for setting up such a contract can be found in Appendix 1.
* Conflict of interest: CSID Network Advisory Board members are eligible to receive honoraria. CSID Network expects conflict of interest disclosure to be kept up to date for all board members, staff, project advisory committee members, and other program committee members.
* Anyone may refuse an honorarium, in which case those funds will be directed back to program costs.
* CSID Network is unable to donate honoraria to other organizations on someone’s behalf.

The following types of speaking engagement with CSID Network are unpaid. While unpaid, we believe these speaking engagements offer valuable opportunities for professional visibility, community recognition, and meaningful networking within and beyond the CSID Network:

* Lightning talks (5-10 min), open mic events, discussion participants
* Presentations by core staff or fellows to CSID Network working groups and committees,
* Participation by Network members in “ask me anything” sessions, internal events, and other voluntary public events.

CSID Network does not pay extra if the session is recorded. Honoraria also covers any resources developed for the session (for example, CSID Network does not pay additionally for the development of a slide deck to be used in an event presentation). CSID Network Staff may accept external speaking engagements and are entitled to receive speaker fees/honoraria offered by those external engagements.

Selection Committees and Expert Review

Honoraria may be provided for following:

* Fellowship Selection Committee ($250 USD per cycle)
* Other selection committees ($250 USD per cycle)

CSID Network Staff may accept external committee service and expert review engagements and are entitled to receive honoraria as offered by those external commitments.

### Non-Staff Compensation&#x20;

Overview

CSID Network may engage consultants and other professionals to provide services to our staff, membership, or broader community. We recognize that the scope of services provided may vary widely and that individuals and businesses will likely have their own methodology for calculating their rates. These guidelines are meant to serve as an anchor, not a final determination, and we welcome conversation about our ability to meet your compensation needs if they differ from the rates below.

Pay Structure

CSID Network adheres to the following pay structure when compensating non-staff contractors:

CSID Network’s standard hourly rate is $100 USD/hr.&#x20;

* We will pay a minimum of $85 USD/hr and a maximum of $250 USD/hr
* Note: We will pay a minimum of $65 USD/hr for administrative hours associated with a larger scope of work, but otherwise encourage contractors to align their rates with our $85 USD/hr rate or higher.
