Testing documentation and gitbook integration

This is a change in gitbook. I want to see how it is reflected in github. I want to include an image:

Let's now test a gihub commit:

* It'd be great to have the username in the gitbook commit message
* I think the workflow should be github first, easier to manage userpermissions, etc. We might not even need a paid gitbook account.
* There's a lot of back and forth discussion that has happened in google docs. That's still a good place to start, hopefully more consolidated policies won't need as much back and forth and can be done directly on github 🤞
*
* Testing changes.&#x20;
