Testing documentation and gitbook integration



This is a change in gitbook. I want to see how it is reflected in github.  I want to include an image:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/CSIDNet full logo (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's now test a gihub commit: 
- It'd be great to have the username in the gitbook commit message
- I think the workflow should be github first, easier to manage userpermissions, etc. We might not even need a paid gitbook account.
- There's a lot of back and forth discussion that has happened in google docs. That's still a good place to start, hopefully more consolidated policies won't need as much back and forth and can be done directly on github 🤞
- How do different languages work? Should we set up this from the get go?
